You have enabled <text text="s-s-m-l-droid t-m">SsmlDroid™</text>. Please note that engine might not fully support it, for more information please check the User Guidelines in Settings. If you can't understand the confusing syntax and just want to synthesize plain text, head to Settings and uncheck "Enable <text text="s-s-m-l-droid t-m">SsmlDroid™</text>".

<verbatim verbatim="FAQ">FAQ</verbatim>: If synthesis fails, check your Internet connection in case the selected engine requires Internet connection. Most TTS engines don't support all the features so always try switching to another engine when you encounter problems. If this app crashes or is not responding, please DO submit a report so we can try to fix it. You can also install engines from Play Store, etc.
